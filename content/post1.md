## Scientific methods
That would be so awful if I start explaining to you the importance of Science and over-the-top deal of certainty in scientific methods. So in laymen's words, you observe, enquire, do background research, make hypothesis, undertake rigorous experiments, formulate and test your hypothesis, modify your hypothesis and make conclusions accordingly to have a rich and juicy theory. This is the standard model or flow chart, how the research methodology should be.

For performing sophisticated experiments, a smart experiment design is very crucial. Let me be very clear here that I haven't been engaged in any high scale research work yet, though my room at my home is something of a lab in itself, and from my experience in _room converted to lab_ research work, I can say that having a good experimental design is half work done. As it avoids most of the prescient problems that you think, might come.

Also, it is of importance to know the limits of your experiment and to form testable hypothesis for the observations. I think that's logical enough...


## Experiment Designing
To understand the concept, I'm gonna put it with an example. But before that, you are advised to read following prerequisite terminology and some other know-how.

### Terminology-

#### Placebo Effect: 
Effect engages with your belief system. It is when a positive effect is felt on taking an empty/placebo drug or treatment which didn't actually accredit for any function as such. It's just you believing that the drug is working. But in actuality, it doesn't.

#### Scientific Control group:
Those which are in Control group are not tested. A set of what is being studied, which are taken as reference for comparison are Control group.

#### Scientific Test group:
They are the ones whose factors are varied for studying the effects.

#### Variables:
Variables are the factors or conditions which can be controlled so as to record the cause-effect relationship. There are three types of scientific variables-<br>
1. **Independent Variables-** The factors which are _subjected for_ changes so that effects can be seen.<br>
2. **Dependent Variables-** The factors which are _subjected to_ changes as the independent variables are manipulated.<br>
3. **Control Variables-** These are the outcome of the fact that not all variables can be manipulated in control. So they are the factors which the researchers try to keep deliberately constant so that there can be a clear distinction of them from independent variables. They are also called **Constant Variables**.


Let's take a simple example for this one. Say you're editing your picture on some photo editing app. Here, unedited version of your picture is **Control group**, picture opened on the app for editing is the **Test group**, filters which you're annexing to it are **Independent Variables**, looks of your picture is **Dependent Variable** and **Control Variables** may be the app you're using, or device on which you're editing, etc. Lame, but comprehensible...


As a biotechnologist, my content and references here are referring to biological experiments.<br><br>
Most of the time at research work has to deal with cause-effect relationship of drug or chemicals or conditions on different kind of subjects. For this, the group of researchers who are studying them first define the key variables.  They take a special care to minimise the variation in constant variables so that potential impact on dependent variables can be minimised.<br>
Now let's say a group of researchers are studying the effects of a drug on a group of sprint runners. So they _randomly_ give every volunteer a pill, which looks identical but aren't same in chemistry. Just that half of them were empty pills while half were the drug that is going to alter the independent variables within them. Here, it is noteworthy that drug should be distributed randomly, making sure that they follow _Double Blind_ technique. That is, people shouldn't know what pill they are taking so that Placebo effect can be avoided. Over that, even researchers shouldn't know what pill is taken by what examinee. They however, must preserve some traces of the pills from each runner so that they can be chemically studied for their composition so as to record which runner is taking what pill. Now you're probably sitting there and thinking- why can't even researchers know about which one is taking what pill? Well, you know many times we do things inadvertently. If they get to know that, then subconsciously they might give some minor signal, which might not go good in research perspective.<br>
So here, the ones who are taking empty pills are the control group. Speed during the sprint is the Dependent variable. Things that the pill alters are independent variable.

One more important thing, apart from  random  assignment  of  pills that should be followed is that the people under study should have nearly same physique. That is important because the pill should affect them more or less equally. Otherwise unwanted dependent variables might arise that may ultimately spoil the studies, if not make them completely useless.
Also, the study must be carried out under same conditions for all, again to minimise the dependent variables.

The runners, after a month of study, showed say ×% increase in speed by control group, and +% increase in speed by the test group. It is of interest to note that figures × and + become finer and finer as we take more number of volunteers under study. 


Then with these figures and experiment records, a subjective conclusion of your thesis should be filed and submitted to popular science journal for whole world to see!
