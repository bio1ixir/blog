B.Tech. in Bio engineering (formerly Biotechnology) at IITJ has seen its first  undergraduate batch in 2018. As I'm writing this, it makes the senior  most batch of this branch in sophomore year. Many things are yet to  happen to its first batch itself to which respect they can narrate the  know-hows to the world. But still, now that the question is here, I'd  give it a go.


[**Bio engineering at IITJ**](http://iitj.ac.in/academics/index.php?&id=acad_program&prog=12)

Till  2018, IITJ offered only M.Tech. and PhD programs in Bioscience and  Bioengineering. The state-of-the-art research infrastructure and  satisfactory output from the department are supposedly a few reasons  which might have forced the academic administration to start offering  B.Tech. program in Biotechnology since last year.

As  stated on IITJ website also- The Department of Bioscience &  Bioengineering aspires to cater to the technological requirements of the  country by conducting high-quality, translatable research and by  training our students to be technological innovators in Biological  sciences. The research effort of the Department is focused on developing  solutions in the areas of healthcare, the environment and agriculture.

This  program is designed in accordance with current industrial demand  rectifying any chance of passing on obsolete technological approaches  and solutions. So don’t let anyone teach you that Indian engineering  institutes which offers biotechnology train their students with 4  thousand year old technology and all. Mind it!


**Faculty Members:**  Faculty Members of the department are highly qualified in their fields  of expertise which is evident by their over-the-top accomplishments and  research papers. They pursue complex biological questions in the fields  of Microbiology, Systems & Computational Biology, Biomaterials &  Biomechanics, and Biological Processes & Bio-Devices. 
Cancer research has got quite a moot among the bt-minds of IITJ these days. A team from our department even [got their paper published in Nature](http://iitj.ac.in/department/index.php?dept=biology&id=research_highlights_and_initiatives&num=264)!

If  you ask me, I’d say in last two semesters biology lectures had been the  most interactive and interesting of all. You sure would learn a lot  more values from them than biology concepts.


**Opportunities:** The  Department actively collaborates with other Departments of the  Institute and with other Institutions of higher learning in and around  Jodhpur to maximize research and teaching outcomes. Faculty Members of  the Department have active collaborations with colleagues from many  prestigious institutes from India and beyond. Just to name some-

1. King George’s Medical University Lucknow
2. Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow
3. CSIC-UAM, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain
4. Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt, Germany
5. Indian Institute of Technology Madras
6. All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur
7. Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur
8. Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences, Mumbai
9. Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology, Bangalore
10. Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research & Education in Cancer (ACTREC)
11. Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai
12. Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Trivandrum
13. University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA
14. Indian Institute of Technology Bombay
15. Riken Brain Science Institute, Japan
16. Nagoya University, Japan
17. National Brain Research Centre, Gurgaon
18. International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, New Delhi
19. Christian Medical College, Vellore
20. Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore
21. Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai
22. University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, USA
23. Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata
24. Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nürnberg, German

That opens up plethora of opportunities for students associated with BSBE department of IITJ.
Recently,  IITJ has signed a MoU with NAIST, JAPAN to facilitate academic  exchanges, student exchanges, higher studies and internship  opportunities.

As  far as after-graduation opportunities are concerned- opportunities in  corporate sector based on India are less (comparatively). That’s because  it’s still emerging field in India and there is so much yet to do in  Indian biotech industry. Biotech firms in India are not putting enough  funds into R&D consequently clogging the technology of 21st century  to flourish as it should have been. For example, Pharmaceutical  companies in India just tend to produce patented drugs most of the time,  giving rest to their research labs. **But again…if biotech is not a good field ,** [**Kiran Mazumdar Shah**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiran_Mazumdar-Shaw) **wouldn’t be a billionaire**. 
Whilst in countries like China, the USA, etc. there are good…no..great opportunities. They’re doing great at it!

Now  a question hits- Why is the pace of development in biotechnology slow  in India? [a question asked by me on Quora]. In response to my comment  under [an answer](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-pace-of-development-in-biotechnology-slow-in-India/answer/Eshita-Sengupta?ch=10&share=d19e58f8&srid=tB7Yf) on the same question lies the possible explanation-

> **Me-**  These arguments suggests that biotech sort-of 'exist' in India. I'm  pursuing B.Tech. in biotechnology. And what I have realized is that most  of the people in India who are in bioscience and bioengineering are  only into it because they've got no option but to go in pursuit of that  only. Like when I asked my seniors (from other IITs) about future  prospects of B.Tech. in biotechnology, hardly anyone has told me about  future in 'Biotechnology' as such. Everyone was so full of non-core job  prospects, doing MBA, etc. Whilst in countries like the USA, its  condition is equivalent to what Computer Science and Engineering or  Information Technology is in India. Why is that?

> [**Ruptanu Banerjee**](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ruptanu-Banerjee)**-** It’s  simply because the curriculum designed for Biotechnology is not fit for  a so called “9-to-5” jobs like those of IT sectors. A company with  IT/CS engineers are expected to do the job they are assigned by their  superiors in a particular time-frame. The same is not true for a biotech  job. There are n number of factors which can affect any  experiment/process any time. Yeah, it is true that there is a number of  students who are willing to go for a non-core job or administrative job.  The situation is not the same with USA or EU to some extent. It will be  vague to assume that all bachelor degree holders in those countries are  getting a biotech core job immediately after their 10+2+3/4.

I leave rest over to you to develop your own perception about it. 
So  that’s that for corporate jobs. Now if you are one of the inquisitive  kinds, research is the way to go! And once you have your roots in the  core biology, there’s no stopping you! Even Govt.of India offers a  stipend amount to do M.Tech. and PhD in biotechnology. “*It ain’t much, but it’s honest work”* type stipend*.* Still, doing further studies from abroad is encouraged.


**Perks:**

- Being  the first batch of B.Tech. program, direct mentoring from the  professors has always been a plus point for us. 2019 batch is no  different just a bunch of seniors extra to pick you up in the flow!
- Awesome seniors (like me :P)
- Active Biotech club [check [Bio1ixir](https://bio1ixir.github.io/)]
- Other features of 4-year B.Tech. in Bioengineering (formerly B.Tech. in Biotechnology) are as following-

**i.** *Option of 4 - year B.Tech. with Department Specialization in*

	1. Smart Healthcare

	2. Product Realization

**ii.** *Option of 4 - year B.Tech. with Interdisciplinary Specialization in*

	1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) [**WOW!**]

	2. Data and Computational Science

	3. Cognitive Science

**iii.** *Option of 4 - year B.Tech. with Minor in*

	1. Management

	2. Entrepreneurship

**iv.** *Option to convert B.Tech. into 5-year B.tech. + M.Tech. Dual Degree in 7th semester with M.Tech. in Bio-Engineering*


**Words of advise:** Don’t let yourself consumed by inferiority complex for not getting desired college/branch. **In coming years, you’d be glad that you got bio engineering even at such high rank**!
